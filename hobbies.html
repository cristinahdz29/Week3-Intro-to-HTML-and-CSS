      <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
      <p>
        One good thing that has come out of the year 2020 is discovering hobbies
        that I am very passionate about! If you asked me if I had any hobbies
        prior to the pandemic, I would shamefully admit that I didn't have any.
        I'm so glad that is no longer the case!! The follwing are 2 hobbies that
        have kept me sane during quarantine:

      <h2>Plants</h2>
      <p>
        As a child, I would always watch my grandfather tend to his garden. He
        grew all kinds of things ranging from peach trees, to pecan trees to
        mint and a variety of flowers. I never gave it a try myself because I
        always assumed that I didnt have a green thumb. Years later, I've come
        to realize how therapeutic and forgiving plants can be. I, like so many
        others, suffer from generalized anxiety disorder. My houseplants have
        become a safe haven that I can turn to when my bouts of anxiety become
        overwhelming. It has also become a way for me to connect with my
        grandfather after his passing. I like to think he helps keep my plants
        healthy and lively!
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're a new and aspiring plant parent, I suggest starting out with
        resilient and forgiving plants such as spider plants or succulents!
        Caring for these plants will allow yourself to ease into getting used to
        sticking to a watering and fertilizing schedule. If you're interested in
        shopping local for some new plant babies, I highly reccomend checking
        out <a href="http://plantnerdsatl.com/">Plant Nerds</a>, an
        Atlanta-based online plant shop.

        I have definitely gained quite a few "pandemic punds" in the last few
        months, thanks to my love of exploring local eateries! There's something
        about trying new and yummy food that just warms my soul! The following
        are some of my favorite new finds split into categories(listed in no
