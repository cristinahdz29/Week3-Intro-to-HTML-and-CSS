      <h1>My Children (aka pets)</h1>
      <p>
        I am a proud parent of 2 insanely adorable and lovable cats named Peluza
        and Kylo.

      <h3>Peluza</h3>
      <p>
        Peluza came into my life about 7 years ago. Her mom had a litter of
        kittens under our shed and Peluza was the only one who stauyed behind.
        Her name literally translates to "fluffy" in Spanish (I know, so
        original lol). She is a very unique cat in that she hates everything
        that a typical cat would love including catnip, water fountains,
        scratching posts, toys, and wet food. However, she LOVES cuddling, so I
        guess that makes up for it! Sadly, I had to leave her back home with my
        parents after moving to Atlanta because she is an older indoor/outdoor
        cat who hates new environments. But I often send care packages home to
        her!!

      <h3>Kylo</h3>
      <p>
        Kylo is my husband's cat that I have come to love as my own!!! He is the
        total opposite of Peluza. In fact, he is the total opposite of a cat and
        acts more like a dog. He is obsessed with temptations treats, loves to
        play with his toys and is very sociable. He also plays fetch with his
        toy mice. The one thing I dislike about him is that for some strange
        reason, he likes to eat plastic ðŸ˜Ÿ. Over time, I have developed a sixth
        sense and can somehow tell when he's gotten a hold of some.
