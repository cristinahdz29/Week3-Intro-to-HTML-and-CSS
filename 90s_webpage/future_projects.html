    Potential Future Projects
</h1>
<p>
    As I mentioned in my Hobbies page, one of my new found passions is collecting houseplants. As mu coding knowledge continues to grow, I would like to develop some kind of app or webpage that allows me to keep track of my houseplants and all things related to their care. For example, I would like to to be able to record my plants name, its scientific name, whether its indoors or outdoors, watering/fertilizing log, as well as reminders for when it is time to water/fertilize again or repot. 
</p>
<p>
    I am still in the process of brainstorming ideas for this potential project but I will keep you updated!
