      <p>Welcome to my personal webpage that is sporting a 90s theme!</p>
      <p>
        As someone who was born in the 90s, I felt like I HAD to make reference
        to one of my all time favorite 90's movies, "Clueless" (which
        popularized the phrase "as if" 💁🏽‍♀️)
      </p>

        And....if you were a little girl in the late 90s and early 2000s like
        me, you should definitely recognize the background image!! It is one of
        the many colorful and fun Lisa Frank images featured on all the school
        supplies we BEGGED our moms to buy us!!
